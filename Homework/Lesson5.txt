This lesson was about interfaces, services, dependency injection, basic SOLID principles:

The homework is to update 'The shop' application done in lesson2.txt with the concepts explained in :
1. Apply Services principle and separate console printing and shop operations into separate services.
2. In Services constructor there should be no 'new' word, interfaces of services should be used, 
and they should be create(injected) in main method.

EXtra: Add extra service which reads input from a file (like 'list', 'buy', etc) and prints output into separate.
This should be exchangable with ConsolePrinter (use the same interface).
